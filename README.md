# Stock Market Trading AI Bot
This project aims to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) bot that can predict stock prices and select optimal actions for stock market trading. The AI bot uses reinforcement learning techniques to learn from the stock data and make informed decisions.

## Motivation
Stock market trading can be a challenging and risky endeavor, but with the right tools and strategies, it can also be a lucrative investment opportunity. The goal of this project is to create an AI bot that can help traders make more informed and profitable decisions by leveraging the power of machine learning and artificial intelligence.

## Features

Uses reinforcement learning techniques to learn from the stock data and make informed decisions
Can predict stock prices and select optimal actions for stock market trading
Can be trained and tested on different stocks and time periods
Can be customized with different AI algorithms and techniques


## Requirements

* Python 3.6 or higher
* gym
* requests


## Usage
To use the AI bot, you will need to install the required libraries and provide an API endpoint and API key to access the stock data. You can then use the choose_best_ai_bot function to select the best AI bot based on the performance of each AI bot on the given stock data.


## Examples
To select the best AI bot for stock market trading on the "AAPL" stock, using the IEX Cloud API endpoint and an API key of "pk_test_abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz":

To use the AI bot to predict stock prices and select optimal actions for stock market trading, you can call the predict and act methods of the AI bot instance. For example:


prediction = best_bot.predict()
action = best_bot.act(prediction)
