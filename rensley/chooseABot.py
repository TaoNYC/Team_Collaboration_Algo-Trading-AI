def choose_best_ai_bot(bot_types, symbol, endpoint, api_key):
    """
    Select the best artificial intelligence (AI) bot for stock market trading based on the performance of each AI bot
    on the given stock data. This function compares the performance of multiple AI bot types on the given stock data,
    and returns the AI bot that performs the best. The performance of each AI bot is measured by the rewards it
    receives during testing.
    
    Parameters:
        bot_types (list): A list of AI bot types to consider, such as "sarsa", "deep_q_learning", "monte_carlo",
                         "td_learning", "q_learning", "actor_critic", "neural_network", "lstm", "arima",
                         "prophet", or "auto_arima". These represent different AI algorithms and techniques that
                         can be used to predict stock prices and select optimal actions.
        symbol (str): The stock symbol to retrieve stock data for. This is a string representing the ticker symbol
                      of the stock, such as "AAPL" for Apple Inc. or "GOOG" for Alphabet Inc.
        endpoint (str): The API endpoint to retrieve stock data from. This is a string representing the URL of the
                        API endpoint that provides access to the stock data. The endpoint should support the GET
                        method and should return the stock data in JSON format.
        api_key (str): The API key to authenticate the API request. This is a string representing the API key that
                       should be included in the request headers to authenticate the API request.
    
    Returns:
        The best AI bot for stock market trading, based on the performance of each AI bot on the given stock data.
        This is an instance of the AI bot class that performed the best during testing, and can be used to predict
        stock prices
